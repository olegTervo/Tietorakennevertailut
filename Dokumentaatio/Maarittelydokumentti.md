Työ on Helsingin Yliopiston Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit kursin harjoitustyö. Vertailen 4 tietorakennetta, niiden aikavaatimukset ja tarkoitukset. Selvitän, missä tilanteessa kukin on paras.

[Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) - also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a type of search tree, a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. These keys are most often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters. In order to access a key (to recover its value, change it, or remove it), the trie is traversed depth-first, following the links between nodes, which represent each character in the key.

[Binomial heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap) - a data structure that acts as a priority queue but also allows pairs of heaps to be merged. It is important as an implementation of the mergeable heap abstract data type (also called meldable heap), which is a priority queue supporting merge operation. It is implemented as a heap similar to a binary heap but using a special tree structure that is different from the complete binary trees used by binary heaps. Binomial heaps were invented in 1978 by Jean Vuillemin. 

[Fibonacci heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) - a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees. It has a better amortized running time than many other priority queue data structures including the binary heap and binomial heap. Michael L. Fredman and Robert E. Tarjan developed Fibonacci heaps in 1984 and published them in a scientific journal in 1987. Fibonacci heaps are named after the Fibonacci numbers, which are used in their running time analysis. 

[Red–black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) - is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node stores an extra bit representing "color" ("red" or "black"), used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
